# Apache Batik 1.7

A compiled uber-jar version of the [Apache Batik SVG Toolkit](http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/), version 1.7. This is prepackaged to work with [Antimony](https://github.com/sjhcockrell/antimony) for webfont conversion.

I made this because the original `batik-ttf2svg.jar` didn't contain all its dependencies for some reason, making it not terribly portable.
